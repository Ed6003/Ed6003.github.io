# Key Contributions

- Proficient in **Fusion 360** for detailed 3D modeling of critical TBM components such as the grippers and main body.
- Utilized **Abaqus** for stress analysis, focusing on a new gripper pad design crucial to temporarily anchor the TBM during soil digging and removal.
- Demonstrated commitment by conducting a remote stress analysis on a new body design during vacation using VDI software from a phone without computer access.

# Responsibilities

- Collaborated cross-functionally between teams to incorporate CAD models into our TBM.
- Conducted **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** simulations to assess structural integrity, performance, and adequate safety index.
- Provided simulation-driven recommendations to improve TBM components.

# Team Achievements

- **Top 6 Global Finalists** in Elon Musk's Not-a-Boring competition 2023.
- Achieved impressive results since its founding in 2021, improving competition rankings year on year.

# Skills Developed
